# Hub4U

Hub4U is an app for finding directions to use with the Hubway bike sharing system in Boston, MA.  Users enter a start and end location, and Hub4U determines the closest Hubway stations to both locations.  Hub4U calculates the distance to walk from your starting location to a Hubway station, bike from that station to the one closest to your destination, and then walk from the second Hubway station to your final location.  Hub4U also keeps track of how many bikes or docks are available at the time of your search so you won't be sent to a station with no bikes or places to park your bike.
